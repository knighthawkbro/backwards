# Backwards (COMP 2000 - Data Structures)

What it can do:
- Create an Array and perform functions as a datatype doubly-linked list
- Runs through a driver program testing all the doubly-linked list functions
- Create a linked list and perform functions as a datatype doubly-linked list
- reads a message.txt file and prints all the previous other words.

How to build yourself:
- DL [Golang](https://golang.org/dl/)
- CD to backwards directory
- run ```go build backwards.go```
- remove other executable ```rm backwards```
- run ```.\backwards.go```
- conversly you can just run ```go run backwards.go``` for an instant execution of the program
- I think you may need to set your [$GOPATH](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH) and create a src folder within for go build to work
